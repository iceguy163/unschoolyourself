<p>Many, many colleges and decent jobs require one to have a high school diploma. As one gets a high school diploma by finishing school and unschoolers have not, they cannot get this coveted diploma.</p>
<p>Or can they?</p>

<h1 class="center">High School Equivalencies!</h1>
<p>If you live in North America or various other countries, you can obtain an equivalent to the high school diploma by taking a test.</p>
<p>The main two tests taken nowadays are the old and famous <b>GED</b> and the new and rising <b>HiSET.</b></p>
<h1>GED</h1>
<p>	The General Educational Development test, popularly abbreviated as the GED, is perhaps the first such equivalency test, and is still the most widely used to this day.</p>
<p>	The GED test is split into four subject tests: Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts. Each test is scored from 100-200, with a score of at least 145 being passing.</p>
<p>	By scoring at least 145 on all four subjects, you will be awarded an official GED certificate by the state. By scoring 165 or above, you not only pass but are considered <b>College Ready,</b> and 175+ will even give you college credit!</p>
<p>	And this certificate only takes on average up to <b>3 months</b> to study for, and some people (maybe even <b>you!</b>) study well in far less time!</p>
<h1>HiSET</h1>
<p>	The other major high school equivalency test in North America is the HiSET, officially known as the High School Equivalency Test.</p>
<p>	While the GED has four subject tests, the HiSET takes it up to five: Language Arts - Reading, Language Arts - Writing, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science. In addition, the HiSET taker must also write an essay at the end of the Writing test.</p>
<p>	In order to pass, the test taker must score at least 8 on a scale of 1 to 20 on all tests, with a total score of 45. On a scale of 1 to 6, they must get a 2 on the Writing essay.</p>
<p>	While the HiSET test does not reward any college credits, a score of 15 out of 20 on any of the tests could indicate that the pupil is ready for college-level classes.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>	Time is perhaps one of the most important resources we have. Money can be saved and, if lost, be brung back. Time, however, always runs out. Once a second passes, you can never, ever get it back.</p>
<p>	It takes 4 years to get a normal high school diploma, but less than 3 months of studying to get the equivalent of one.</p>
<p>	So if you're still in school to get a diploma despite being miserable there, why not get one in a fraction of the time?</p>
<p>	You won't have to go to that place you hate all the time, and you'll also have that precious degree!</p>
<p>	Then you can spend what would have been your last few years of school finding out what you like and what you're good at, planning what you want to do next, and most importantly: having fun!</p>
