<p>If you are reading this, you probably already have reasons to quit school. This page, thus, serves to pretty much reinforce the idea. If you hate school because it is stupid then, well, you're right, but there are reasons why it is stupid and that's what I will cover here.</p>
<p>If you want to quit school, there is nothing wrong with you. It is not a wrong, horrible action that common perception seems to imply. Instead, quitting school may so turn out to be the best decision you have made if you practice self-directed learning.</p>
<p><br>The truth is, schools do not educate. Most of the things you learn in school, you will forget and never use again. And if you ever need that information again, thankfully in the 21st century, we have very intelligent devices on our desks and even in our pockets that are ready to help us at any time. They, of course, are called computers and smartphones.</p>
<p>So when you ask, "When will I ever use this again?"
<br>Unless it's related to your future career, you will only use it after looking it up on Google. Despite what some teachers may say.
</p>
<p>Well, if school doesn't even do its job right, why are we going there anyway?</p>
<p><b>Because education isn't the only job of school. It does another job much more spectacularly.</b></p>
<p>The best learning takes place when one cannot use the bathroom without permission or wear hats, according to schools that is.</p>
<p>Both of those examples are stupid yet commonplace, but they're only the very tip of the iceberg of how schools control students' lives.</p>
<p>That's right, the thing schools are best at is <b>control.</b></p>
<p>Schools demand obedience from students. Six hours a day, for thirteen years, young people are made to sit down for hours on end in a room, being lectured on things they will likely never need to know again. Even when they are out of school for the day, their time is most likely invaded again in the form of homework.</p>
<p>Instead of doing anything remotely interesting, schools make students devote a large chunk of their time to boring things.</p>
<p>But there wouldn't be such devotion if it weren't for school's trusty weapon:</p>
<h2 class="center"><b>Introducing: The dictatorship of grades!</b></h2>
<p>Grades, grades, grades, if there's one word to describe what school is about, it's grades. </p>
<p>But grades are supposed to measure your learning, so they should be good, right?</p>
<p>Well you get good grades by doing homework, tests, and other assignments, after which the knowledge you were using would probably be forgotten and never used again. If grades really were about measuring learning, they would go up if you demonstrated your passion for the subject.</p>
<p>Instead, grades act more as a way to measure how much you obeyed the teacher and did your homework. But this little rating system wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for how people treat it so seriously.</p>
<p>Grades are treated as if your future depends on them. If you get bad grades, adults around you may sadly act as if the world is ending. </p>
<p>"Do your homework," they then say. Instead of doing what you are passionate about, what becomes important is homework, as adults fear that the other way around would lead to a terrible future.</p>
<p>School becomes about homework, your passions become secondary and unimportant, which tragically leads so many young people to give up their dreams and lose their creativity. Youth start to obey the teachers, to do the homework, as that is what is rewarded and anything besides that is punished, and as common sense dictates, rewards feel a lot better than punishments.</p>
<p>Because of how important adults treat grades, young people may start to believe that their grades define who they are. While those with good grades may feel confident and proud, the ones that don't may feel miserable, could think that they are worthless and have no future. Since you are reading this, you could be part of the latter.</p>
<p>Your grades, however, do not define you. Despite what many people say, bad grades do not mean your future is doomed, and good grades are not a guarantee of a successful future.</p>
<p>You are not worthless at all, just because you may be bad at school (which honestly isn't something to be ashamed of), doesn't mean you are bad at everything in life. You may likely have a passion that managed to survive the wounds of school, waiting to burn bright once again.</p>
<p>If you want to stay in school, that's fine, your decision is respected. But if school is making you so miserable, and deep down you want out of there so bad, why keep going to a place that you hate?</p>
<p>Sure, many colleges and jobs require high school diplomas, but the vast majority of them (over 95%) also accept GEDs, which can be obtained in far less time.</p>
<p>If you want to claim your time back, if you want to learn in a healthier way, if you want a fuller life here and now, you must find an alternative to school. You could just get a GED, you could start homeschooling, you could attend Sudbury school instead. These options could allow you to pursue another education, a much richer education: Self-directed education.</p>
<h2><b>What is self-directed education?</b></h2>
<p>Self-directed education is when the learner is in charge of their own learning and takes responsibility for it. This, however, doesn’t mean they assign themselves homework or take tests, though a small minority may do so. Rather, self-directed learners learn through living itself. They may read information such as books and websites, they could go to museums, cities, or even other countries to learn about a topic. They could make projects related to their interest, such as art or software. Even a fun, leisurely day at a playground (for the younger ones) or a hangout spot (for the older ones) could be very educational!</p>
<p>By being allowed to freely pursue one’s own interests, self-directed learners often live successful lives doing what they are passionate about. And you, my friend, could be just like them.</p>
<p>In order to truly learn, one must educate themselves, and just as importantly, they must be given the freedom to do so.</p>
<p>Right now, your full potential to learn is put in a cage. <b>It's time to let it free.</b></p>
<h2><b>If you are interested in directing your own education:</b></h2>
<p>Read the <a href="resources.html">resources page,</a> read this <a href="unschoolyourself.html">article on how to unschool yourself.</a> Read books, read articles, teach yourself new skills. <b>But most importantly, live life and have fun!</b></p>
<p><b>Education and learning shouldn’t be suffering! Start your self-directed education!</b></p>
