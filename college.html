<p>College is a popular choice for teens and young adults after they finish school. Since you are reading this, probably either want to go to college or are thinking about it.</p>
<p>But if you are unschooled, you may believe that your nonconventional education would close the doors to college.</p>
<p>But this of course is not true.</p>
<p>If you are a current or aspiring unschooler, and you want to go to college, that is absolutely possible.</p>
<p>Here are my tips:</p>
<h2>Get a GED/HiSET</h2>
<p>Many colleges and universities require one to have a high school diploma or equivalent. If it is needed to get into your desired college, consider <a href="ged.html">studying for and taking the GED or HiSET test.</a> The higher the score, the more likely you will be to be accepted into the college. You could even get college credit!</p>
<h2>Take the SAT or ACT test</h2>
<p>Other common tests taken to enter college are the SAT and ACT tests. However, while the GED and HiSET are taken to get a high school equivalency, the SAT and ACT are mainly taken as a standardized test in high schools and may be required to attend certain colleges and universities.</p>
<p>By studying for the SAT or ACT test and passing, your score may give you a better chance at getting into your desired college. </p>
<h2>Build a portfolio</h2>
<p>To stand out from all the other applicants, try creating a portfolio of projects, skills, etc. that you made/have. These could be art projects you made, a photo album you took, small little games you coded, etc.</p>
<h2>Consider attending community college</h2>
<p>Community colleges are 2-year long institutions that are generally cheaper than 4-year colleges. Most community colleges will accept anyone with a high school diploma or equivalent. If you attend community college and do well in it, you may have a greater chance into getting into a 4-year college, and save some tuition money too!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>College is a great and prestigious choice for those who choose to go there.</p>
<p>Your nonconventional learning, as I have shown, will not mean you can't go to college.</p>
<p>In fact, being a self-directed and self-motivated learner could make colleges <i>more</i> likely accept to you. By showing that you are willing to learn things, that you can commit to goals, and are self-motivated, the doors to college will be wide open.</p>
