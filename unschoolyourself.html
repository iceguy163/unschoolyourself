<h1 class = "center">So You Wanna Quit School, Huh?</h1>
<p>The following is advice on how to quit school.</p>
<h2>The Reason</h2>
<p>If you are here, you are tired of the busyness of schooling. You are fed up with the boring, time-wasting, and sometimes stressful and soul-crushing nature of school. You are here because you want something different.</p>
<h2 class = "center"> And you know what, there is nothing wrong with that.<br><br>At all.</h2>
<h2>Have a Plan</h2>
<p>You may have heard people say that people who quit school aren't thinking of the "big picture" and are thinking of the small one. But you can most definitely quit because you have big plans in your life and you want to pursue them.<br><br>
Think, what is it that you would rather do instead of school? Could you be learning a skill such as <strong>programming,</strong> or the arts such as drawing and music? Could you get a GED, take the SAT, and go to college or trade school instead of high/middle school?
Maybe you would like to start your own business?</p>
<p><br><br>Having some sort of life plan would be very helpful and rewarding.</p>
<h2>If you are able to leave school without anyone's permission:</h2>
<p>If you are 18 or the dropout age in your state, quitting school couldn't be more simple. On your last day, leave all of your books and other school supplies in your locker. Empty out your backpack, but don't leave it at school. You'll be using it for far better purposes.<br><br>
Get your backpack and anything else you're bringing, and walk down the hallway. If you wish, wave to all of the friends that you see, but don't think you won't be able to see them anymore.<br><br>
Go outside and get the biggest smile on your face. Take a deep breath in, out.<br><br>
If you have a car and it's in the school parking lot, go inside your car and start it. If you don't have a car, maybe you should just wait for the bus. Drive on home.<br><br><br>
And never come back.</p>
<h2>Convincing Your Parents</h2>
<p>If you are under 18 or the dropout age in your state, you will need to convince your parents to let you leave school. Depending on what your parents are like, this could be easy or hard.</p>
<p><br>As stated above, knowing what you want to do after leaving school will be helpful in convincing your parents in letting you do so. They may think that you will be lazy and play video games all day, so planning to do something productive instead could (potentially) give them peace of mind.</p>
<p><br>Maybe write down what you want to say to them on a piece of paper or a Google doc. State that you want to leave school and do unschooling. Write down what you would rather do instead.
Also consider listing content that your parents could consume, such as books by John Holt or the <a href="https://self-directed.org">ASDE</a> website. This could give them a better idea on what unschooling is and make you seem more credible.</p>
<p><br>When you are ready and confident, try to have a polite, formal conversation with your parents about considering unschooling. Explain why you want to unschool, what you want to do instead of school, and give resources related to unschooling.</p>
<h2>If you fail:</h2>
<p>Remember the reasons why they rejected unschooling. For example, if they think you would be doing nothing productive all day and would be lazy, show them examples of unschoolers living productive and responsible lives, and try to show that you will be the same. If they think unschooling will make you unable to go to college, show them <a href="https://www.blakeboles.com/cwhs/">"College Without High School"</a>, an awesome book by Blake Boles about going to college without finishing high school.</p>
<p>Show them the opposite. Show them that unschooling would be great for you instead of as bad as they think. Consider revising your little paper and writing a new one, debunking myths about unschooling.
<br>If all else fails, you can still unschool once you reach age 18.<br>If you feel unschooling is the right path for you, keep going and keep trying to convince them!</p>
<h2>And if you succeeded:</h2>
<h1 class="center">CONGRATULATIONS!</h1>
<h2 class="center">You are officially an unschooler now! A new, brighter life awaits you!</h2>
