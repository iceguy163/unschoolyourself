<p>You know this, most people in general know this too. You are made to do unbelievably boring things and cannot do what it is you are deeply passionate about. You are made to spend 12 years of your life in this institution, imagine what kind of life you would have had outside of it!</p>

<h2>What is unschooling?</h2>
<p>Imagine every Monday through Friday, you didn't have to go to school. You didn't have to do homework, take tests, get graded. Instead, you learned by reading books you chose, going to museums, using the internet, hanging out with friends, doing projects, and other activities! This is what unschooling involves. Unschooling is a form of homeschooling based on the principle of self-directed education. The learner chooses what they are going to learn and how they are going to learn it.</p>
<h2>But isn't that just playing video games all day?</h2>
<p>While unschoolers may play video games as a hobby, they also focus on more productive things as well. Many unschoolers also learn through getting part-time jobs, taking community college courses and workshops, and starting their own business.</p>
